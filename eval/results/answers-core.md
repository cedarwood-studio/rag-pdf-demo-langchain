| in-09 | What is the difference between a precursor and an indicator of an incident? | answered | correct | supported | NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf p.36 | A precursor is a sign that an incident may occur in the future, while an indicator is a sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring now. Most attacks do not have identifiable precursors, but indicators are more common and can include various signs of malicious activity [1]. |
| in-10 | How soon after an incident should the lessons learned meeting take place? | answered | correct | supported | NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf p.48 | The lessons learned meeting should be held within several days of the end of the incident [1]. |
| in-11 | What categories describe how much effort it takes to recover from an incident? | answered | correct | supported | NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf p.43 | The categories that describe the effort required to recover from an incident are: Regular, where recovery time is predictable with existing resources; Supplemented, where recovery time is predictable with additional resources; Extended, where recovery time is unpredictable and requires additional re |
| in-12 | What structures can an incident response team have? | answered | correct | supported | NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf p.23 | An incident response team can have several structures, including a Central Incident Response Team, which handles incidents throughout the organization; Distributed Incident Response Teams, where multiple teams are responsible for different segments of the organization; and a Coordinating Team, which |
