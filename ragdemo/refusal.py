"""The refusal path: decide whether the retrieved passages are close enough to answer from.

Three checks, all made before any answer is written:

1. The best passage must reach the similarity threshold.
2. If the question uses a word that appears nowhere in the corpus, the best
   passage must reach a stricter threshold instead.
3. When the reranker is on, the best cross-encoder score must reach the rerank
   threshold. This is the check aimed at questions that are on the corpus
   topic but not answered by it.
